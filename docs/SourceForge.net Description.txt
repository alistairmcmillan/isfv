iSFV is a package management tool to test the integrity of files described by a SFV file.  It parses the SFV file and makes sure all files described inside it exist and are not corrupt.  It uses the CRC32 values for testing if files are corrupt.  iSFV might be able to create SFV files.  It should be compatible with other SFV programs and files, especially WinSFV.

It is different from other solutions like MacSFV because the GUI will be much easier to use and it will be a Universal Binary and open source compared to a PPC only binary and closed source.  Not many other tools exist for the Macintosh platform that will provide such a nice interface for doing a common process such as checking SFVs.  iSFV might include a Dashboard widget for easy drag and drop checking and an Automator action for automating the verification of SFV files.
